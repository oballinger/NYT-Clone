        Blast damage assessment in Beirut is being carried out using
        two-dimensional satellite imagery. These approaches underestimate damage by
        failing to capture damage done to the sides of buildings. I outline an
        alternative approach using Open Street Map data to create a 3D model of Beirut
        and the explosion to analyze directional blast damage.
      </p>
      <p></p>
	</br>
      <p><strong>Satellite Imagery and its Limits</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Following the recent explosion in Beirut, I built a tool that uses Sentinel-2
        imagery to map the destruction caused by the blast. After some trial and
        error, I arrived at a fairly simple two step process: first, measuring the
        change in spectral signatures between pre- and post-explosion images. Second,
        applying an X-Means clustering algorirthm to the resulting image (yielding the
        map on the right), or taking the absolute difference (yielding the map on the
        left):
      </p>
      	</div>
			<div class="wide-img-70">
				<img src="assets/img/IMG_1.png" alt="">
			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Red areas on the left indicate high levels change between the pre- and post-
        explosion images. On the right, the magnitude, direction, and spectral
        characteristcs of the change are used to classify different types of damage;
        green indicates minor changes, red and orange seem to indicate burnt
        areas, while purple areas match places that suffered structural damage. These
        align fairly closely to a damage map of Beirut generated by NASA.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Though satellite imagery analysis is undoubtedly one of the best tools we have
        at our disposal to analyze this sort of phenomenon, it appears to
        systematically underestimate the extent of damage in Beirut.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Below is one of the most viewed videos of the explosion:</p>
	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stunning video shows explosions just minutes ago at Beirut port <a href="https://t.co/ZjltF0VcTr">pic.twitter.com/ZjltF0VcTr</a></p>&mdash; Borzou Daragahi ðŸ–ŠðŸ—’ (@borzou) <a href="https://twitter.com/borzou/status/1290675854767513600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Geolocating this video was pretty simple thanks to the Greek Orthodox church
        (highlighted in green below) and the road leading to it (highlighted in blue).
        The red box indicates the likely location (33.889061, 35.515909) from which
        the person was filming:
      </p>

			<div class="wide-img-70">

			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The video shows heavy damage being sustained by areas well outside the zones
        classified as damaged in the maps above (both my own and NASA's). Indeed,
        substantial damage was reported several kilometers away.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Why are satellite images underestimating damage in Beirut? Satellite images
        are taken from above, and are two-dimensional. Much of the damage caused by
        the blast, however, was directional; the pressure wave hit the sides of
        buildings, as shown in this diagram from a FEMA manual:
      </p>
      </div>
			<div class="wide-img-70">
				<img src="assets/img/IMG_3.png" alt="">
			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Areas close to the explosion suffered so much damage that it could be seen
        from above, but even if an apartment building had all of its windows blown
        out, this would not necessarily be visible in a top-down view. Even for radar,
        which does technically collect data in three dimensions, the angle problem
        remains; a high resolution radar might be able to tell you how tall an
        apartment complex is, but it won't give you a clear image of all sides. Case
        in point: the NASA damage map was created using Sentinel-1 SAR data. In a
        nutshell, damage assessment in this case is a three-dimensional problem, and
        remote sensing is a two-dimensional solution.
      </p>
      <p></p>
	</br>
      <p><strong>Creating a 3D model of Beirut</strong></p>
      <p>
        To create a more accurate rendering of directional blast damage, three
        dimensional data are required. Data from Open Street Maps (OSM) contains
        information on both the "footprints" (i.e., the location and shape) as well as
        the height of buildings, which is enough to create a three dimensional model
        of Beirut. 3D rendering was done in Blender using the Blender-OSM add-on to
        import a satellite basemap, terrain raster, and OSM data.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Geolocated videos of the blast can be used to verify and adjust the model.
        Below is a side-by-side comparison of the twitter video and a 3D rendition of
        OSM data:
      </p>
      </div>
			<div class="wide-img-70">
				<img src="assets/img/IMG_4.png" alt="">
			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Some slight adjustments to the raw OSM data were made to achieve the image on
        the right. The building footprints are generally very accurate and
        comprehensive in coverage, but the building height data does occasionally have
        to be adjusted manually. A simple and reliable way of doing this is to look at
        the shadows cast by the building on the satellite base map and scale
        accordingly. I also added a rough texture to the buildings to help
        differentiate them, and added the domed roof of the Greek Orthodox church for
        reference.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        For good measure, a second video is geolocated following the same procedure:
      </p>

      <p></p>

        The second pier (highlighted in green) and the angle (in blue) serve as
        references:

      <p>
        The video was taken from the rooftop of a japanese restaurant called Clap
        Beirut (in red above). This is confirmed by a picture of the rooftop bar on
        google images, which matches the bar that can be seen at 0:02 in the twitter
        video. Below is a comparison of the video view and the 3D OSM model:

        Though somewhat grainy, the basemap on the OSM rendering shows the same
        parking lot in the foreground, the second pier, and the same two buildings
        highlighted in yellow. Having created a 3D model of Beirut using OSM data, we
        can now simulate how the explosion would interact with the cityscape.
      </p>
      <p></p>
	</br>
      <p><strong>Using a Viewshed Analysis to Assess Blast Exposure</strong></p>
      <p>
        As the pressure wave moved through the Beirut, some buildings bore the full
        force of the explosion, while others were partially shielded by taller
        structures. A viewshed analysis can be conducted to identify surfaces that
        were directly exposed to the explosion by creating a lighting object at ground
        zero; areas that are lit up experienced unobstructed exposure to the blast:
      </p>
      	</div>
			<div class="wide-img">
				<img src="assets/img/GIF_1.gif" alt="">
			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Pressure waves, like sound, are capable of diffraction (beding around small
        obstructions). To roughly simluate this, the lighting object is gradually
        raised, allowing the light to pass "around" obstructions. Warehouses on the
        Eastern side of the docks, as well as the first row of apartment buildings
        facing the docks are immediately affected. As the lighting object rises above
        the warehouse, more areas suffer direct exposure.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Using two lighting objects-- a red one at 10 meters and a blue one at 20
        meters above the warehouse at ground zero-- the intensity of the blast in
        different areas is highlighted; red areas suffered direct exposure, blue areas
        suffered partially obstructed exposure, and black areas were indirectly
        exposed.
      </p>
      </div>
			<div class="wide-img">

		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        In the immediate vicinity of the explosion the large "L" shaped building
        (Lebanon's strategic grain reserve) is bright red, and was barely left
        standing. It absorbed a large amount of the blast, shielding areas behind it
        and thereby casting a long blue shadow to the West. If one refers back to the
        satellite damage maps above, there appears to be significantly less damage in
        the area just West of ("behind") the grain silo, roughly corresponding to the
        blue shadow above. While these areas were still heavily damaged, they seem to
        have suffered less damage than areas of equal distance to the East.
      </p>
      <p></p>
	</br>
      <p><strong>Accounting for Diffraction</strong></p>
      <p>
        The viewshed analysis tells us which sides of a building are exposed to the
        blast, but it's a pretty rough approximation of the way the pressure wave
        would respond to obstacles in its path. As previously mentioned, pressure
        waves behave much like sound waves or waves in water: they bounce off of
        objects, move around obstructions, and gradually fade.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        To get a more precise idea of the way in which the blast interacted with the
        urban environment, we can model the blast as an actual wave using the "dynamic
        wave" feature in Blender. This effectively involves creating a two-dimensional
        plane, telling it to behave like water, and simulating an object being dropped
        into the water. By putting an obstruction in this plane, we can see how the
        wave responds to it. As an example, the grain silo has been isolated below:
      </p>
        </div>
			<div class="wide-img">
				<img src="assets/img/GIF_2.gif" alt="">
			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        As the blast hits the side of the silo, it is reflected. Two large waves can
        be seen traveling to the right: the initial blast wave, and the reflection
        from the silo which rivals the initial wave in magnitude. To the left, the
        wave travels around the silo but is significantly weakened.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Broadening the focus and adding the rest of the OSM data back in, we can
        observe how the pressure wave interacted with buildings on the waterfront:
      </p>
        </div>
			<div class="wide-img">
				<img src="assets/img/GIF_3.gif" alt="">
			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The warehouses on the docks were omitted to emphasize the interaction between
        the pressure wave and the waterfront buildings; their light metal structure
        and low height means they would have caused little reflection anyway. The
        general pattern of the dynamic wave is consistent with the viewshed, but adds
        a layer of detail. The blast is reflected off of the silo towards the East,
        leading to a double hit. Though the wave still moves around the silo to the
        West, the pressure is diminished. Once the wave hits the highrises, the
        pattern becomes noisy as the wave both presses forward into the mainland and
        is reflected back towards the pier.
      </p>
      <p></p>
	</br>
      <p><strong>Modeling the Pressure Wave</strong></p>
      <p>
        Now that we've accounted for the directionality of the blast and the influence
        of buildings, we can model the pressure wave itself. An expanding sphere
        centered at ground zero is used to model the progression of the pressure wave
        through the city. To get a visual sense of the blast's force, the color of the
        sphere will be a function of the pressure exerted by pressure wave.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The pressure exerted by the explosion in kilopascals (kPa) at various
        distances can be calculated using the DoD's Blast Effects Computer, which
        allows users to input variables such as the TNT equivalent of the ordnance,
        storage method, and elevation. Though there are several estimates, the blast
        was likely equivalent to around 300 tons of TNT. The direct "incident
        pressure" of the pressure wave is shown in blue. However, pressure waves from
        explosions that occur on the ground are reflected upwards, amplifying the
        total pressure exerted by the blast. This "reflected pressure" is shown in
        orange:

        For reference, 137 kPa results in 99% fatalities, 68 kPa is enough to cause
        structural damage to most buildings, and 20 kPa results in serious injuries.
        1-6 kPa is enough to break an average window. At 1km, the reflected pressure
        of the blast (18 kPa) was still enough to seriously injure. Precisely
        calculating the force exerted by an explosion is exceptionally complicated,
        however, so these numbers should be treated as rough estimates. Further
        analysis of the damage caused by blasts blast can be derived from the UN's
        Explosion Consequences Analysis calculator which provides distance values for
        different types of damage and injuries.

      <p>
        Linking the values in this graph to the color of the pressure wave sphere
        provides a visual representation of the blast's force as it expands. An RGB
        color scale corresponds to the blast's overpressure at three threshold values. The animation below is triggered by scrolling slowly:

      <p>
        By keeping the lighting object from the viewshed analysis and placing it
        within the expanding sphere of the pressure wave, we combine two key pieces of
        information: the pressure exerted by the blast (the color of the sphere), and
        the level of directional exposure (brightness).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Now, referring back to the two geolocated twitter videos from earlier, we can
        recreate the blast in our 3D model and get some new insights. Below is a
        side-by-side comparison of the first video and the 3D model:
      </p>
        </div>
			<div class="wide-img">
				<img src="assets/img/GIF_5.gif" alt="">
			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Judging by the twitter video alone, it would be very hard to tell the fate of
        the person filming or the damage caused to the building that they were in.
        However, the 3D model shows that despite having an unobstructed view of the
        explosion, the incident pressure of the pressure wave had decreased
        significtantly by the time it reached the viewing point. The blue-green color
        corresponds to roughly 15 kPa-- enough to injure and break windows, but not
        enough to cause structural damage to the building.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The second twitter video was taken slightly closer to ground zero, but the
        view was partially obstructed by the grain silo:
      </p>
        </div>
			<div class="wide-img">
				<img src="assets/img/GIF_6.gif" alt="">
			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Though the pressure wave probably exerted more pressure compared to the first
        angle, the partial obstruction of the grain silo likely tempered the force of
        the blast.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <p><strong>Assessing Damage to the Skyline Tower</strong></p>
      <p>
        As a concrete example of how this approach can be used to assess damage (or
        predict it, if one had the foresight), let us consider the Skyline Tower,
        pictured below following the explosion:
      </p>
      </div>
			<div class="wide-img-70">
				<img src="assets/img/IMG_8.png" alt="">
			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This partial side view shows two faces of the building, labelled "A" and "B"
        above. Side A was nearly perpendicular to the blast, and just 600 m from
        ground zero. Based on the previous modeling, the pressure wave exerted roughly
        40 kPa on this side of the building. The corner where sides A and B meet,
        highlighted in green, shows total destruction of windows, removal of most
        siding panels, and structural damage. The back corner, highlighted in red,
        shows many windows still intact, indicating that the maximum overpressure on
        this side of the building likely didn't exeed 10 kPa. In other words, standing
        on the front balcony would likely have led to serious injury but standing on
        the back balcony would have been relatively safe.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The animation below shows the Skyline Tower as it is hit by the pressure wave,
        with sides A and B labeled:
      </p>
        </div>
			<div class="wide-img">
				<img src="assets/img/GIF_7.gif" alt="">
			</div>
		<div class="article--center">
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The bright green color of the pressure wave indicates a strong likelihood of
        structural damage. Side A can be seen taking a direct hit, while side B is
        angled slighly away. Despite not being directly exposed to the blast, it
        likely still took reflective damage from some of the neighbouring buildings.
        Both the incident overpressure indicated by the color of the sphere, as well
        as the relative brightness of sides A and B both correspond closely to the
        observed damage taken by the Skyline Tower.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Further Research</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Though satellite imagery analysis is an indispensable tool in disaster
        response, it has limitations. Urban blast damage in particular is difficult to
        assess accurately because it is highly directional and much of it cannot be
        seen from a bird's eye view. Using free and open source tools, an interactive
        3D model of an urban explosion can be generated, allowing for a highly
        detailed investigation of directional blast damage. This can be achieved in
        three steps:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        First, creating a 3D model of the urban area using Blender and Open Street
        Maps data. Second, conducting a viewshed analysis using lighting objects to
        gauge levels of unobstructed exposure to the pressure wave. Third, modeling
        the explosion using geolocated videos of the event and ordnance calculators.
        For added detail, a dynamic wave analysis can be used to more precisely model
        how the pressure wave interacts with buildings.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Once properly modeled, the explosion can be viewed from any angle in the city.
        The viewshed analysis can be calibrated more finely by ground-truthing various
        damage levels (e.g. broken windows) at different locations. In the absence of
        an official address registry in Beirut, OSM is already being used by the
        Lebanese Red Cross (donate here) to conduct neighborhood surveys assessing
        blast damage. As such, this type of damage analysis can quickly be integrated
        into relief efforts, adapted to model disasters in different cities, and can
        even be used to simulate the destructive potential of hypothetical explosions
        to promote readiness.
